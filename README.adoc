= Spring Data REST npm module

This npm module isn't much. It's just a preconfigured way to talk to a Spring Data REST service via https://github.com/cujojs/rest[rest.js].

== What is Spring Data REST?

Please check out my slide show from SpringOne 2014, https://speakerdeck.com/gregturn/springone2gx-2014-spring-data-rest-data-meets-hypermedia[Spring Data REST: Data meets hypermedia]. It is a quick intro into what Spring Data REST offers.

== What does this module have?

To talk to Spring Data REST, you essentially need a client configured for HAL. rest.js provides this feature. It just takes a few extra steps to configure it.

You can either do a lot of reading, like I did, or simply use this module to get going right away.

For an example of making REST calls, look at this snippet from the tests:

[source,javascript]
----
require('should');

var sdr = require('sdr');

sdr.restInvoker({method: 'GET', path: uriWithEmbeddedEmployees})
	.done(function(response) {

		response.status.code.should.equal(200);
		response.headers['Content-Type'].should.equal('application/hal+json');

		var employees = response.entity._embedded.employees;

		employees
			.should.be.an.Array
			.and.have.lengthOf(1);

		var employee = employees[0];

		employee.firstName.should.equal('Bilbo');
		employee.lastName.should.equal('Baggins');
		employee.title.should.equal('thief');
		employee._links
			.should.be.an.Object
			.and.have.property('self');
	})
----

Making REST calls using `restInvoker` returns an A+-compliant promise. This sample shows how to process the response.

NOTE: The `should` clauses are part of should.js, and not part of this API. `should....` are simply assertions. But all
the preceding code is pure rest.js.

To navigate from a root URI through a chain of URIs, use this simple alternative:

[source,javascript]
----
require('should');

var sdr = require('sdr');

sdr.follow(rootUri, ['employees', 'employees'])
	.done(function(employees) {

		employees.should.be.an.Array;
		employees.should.have.lengthOf(1);
		employees[0].firstName.should.equal('Bilbo');
		employees[0].lastName.should.equal('Baggins');
		employees[0].title.should.equal('thief');
		employees[0]._links
			.should.be.an.Object
			.and.have.property('self');
	})
----

This shortcuts the process of navigating through a collection of hypermedia relationships. You can opt to start
from another URI, such as an order link found in an email, and navigate to something else.

Frnakly, THIS is the type of code I prefer writing when talking to HAL-based backends. It sets things up for nice usage
of https://github.com/cujojs/when[when.js] when writing async operations.
